# Compatibility automation

This directory defines the integrations, package-manager matrix, supported
versions, and cross-integration contracts exercised by the compatibility
workflows.

## Scope source of truth

The inventory is limited to integrations documented for the Go SDK in
`neatlogs-docs`: explicit core helpers, Google GenAI, Google ADK, and the A2A
propagation helpers documented under Google ADK. Unsupported provider clients
and coding agents owned by separate repositories are intentionally excluded.

These workflows analyze real published module contents, APIs, dependency
graphs, and the relevant adapter source. They never initialize Neatlogs, call a
live model provider, export traces, or query a Neatlogs backend.

## Pull requests

The pull-request workflow is deterministic and does not receive external
service credentials. It creates an isolated consumer of the real SDK and
verifies module, workspace, vendor, and read-only module-resolution modes.

## Scheduled release monitoring

Twice a day, the scheduled workflow:

1. compares the analyzed version lock with the Go module proxy;
2. records module metadata, dependency, and archive-manifest changes as
   deterministic evidence;
3. optionally asks Gemini for an advisory impact assessment;
4. updates a GitHub issue and optionally alerts Slack when review is needed.

The Gemini assessment is advisory only. It cannot change a compatibility
verdict or make a workflow pass.

Configure these GitHub Actions settings:

- Secret `COMPAT_GEMINI_API_KEY` (optional): a dedicated, quota-limited Gemini
  API key. Without it, deterministic discovery/evidence still runs and the LLM
  step records that it was skipped.
- Variable `COMPAT_GEMINI_MODEL` (optional): model override; defaults to
  `gemini-2.5-flash`.
- Secret `COMPAT_SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` (optional): a channel-specific Slack
  Incoming Webhook. Without it, Slack notification is skipped.

Organization-level secrets scoped only to the SDK repositories are preferred.
The credentials are used only by the scheduled/default-branch workflow and are
never passed to pull-request jobs. Slack failures are non-blocking; alerts are
sent only for newly discovered releases or workflow failures.
